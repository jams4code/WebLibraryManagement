# WebLibraryManagement
Small PHP project.
This is a project that I realized for learning purpose. It represents a library management web application.

# Get started
- Clone the repo
- Start in Netbeans 
- It's written to be used with a MySql database that you can run using uWamp.

It's an old project so I don't commit new feature or refactor the code. I put it here in gitHub because I switched all my project from BitBucket to GitHub.
